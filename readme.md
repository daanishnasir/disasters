Disasters by County
===================

This map will use FEMA data to show disasters in the US by county. 

It looks like a copy of a mapbox example because it is.  


Challenges of this project:

[]Determine the geo center of all US counties
[] Create icons for all disaster types
[] Create a mapbox map with markers for all disasters
[] Implement marker clustering
